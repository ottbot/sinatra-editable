sinatra-editable
================

A simple extension to edit mostly static partials. The extension adds a get and put to '/editable/*', and provides an editable() helper.

For example:
If you put to '/editable/about-us/bio' textile text in params[:content], the extension will
write two files in in APP_ROOT/editable/about-us

The extension will parse the textile and save in 'bio.html', saving the original text in 'bio.textile'.

When you want to display the html, use the helper: editable("about-us/bio")
